description: "DICE is an open-source tool for researchers in time-resolved microscopy and related fields. It evaluates the precision and accuracy of diffusion coefficient estimates derived from optical measures of excited state transport. DICE provides a robust method for assessing experimental accuracy and precision by simulating parameters that mirror your experimental setup."
